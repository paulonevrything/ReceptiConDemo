## RecptiCon

I built a scalable hotel management application that optimizes the job of the hotel receptionist and the hotel manager.

The application has different modules for different roles which include Receptionist, Admin, Accounts among others.

The application is lightweight and easy to deploy to small scale guest houses and lodges. It runs on .NET Framework 3.5 upwards and can thus accomodate older desktop applications.

### Login Page

This is the login page. User's can select their names and input their passwords. The applicaiton takes them to tehir respective modules based on their roles.

### Receptionist Page

This is the receptionist's page where they can reserve a room for a guest and generate a receipt for the guest. It also shows the tax feature, which can be set by the administrator.
